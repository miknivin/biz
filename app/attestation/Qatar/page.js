                        is necessary to get attestation whether educational,
                        non-educational or even commercial.

                        Every qualification certificate issued from outside the
                        State of Qatar, being attested for Qatar now requires
                        Certificate/Diploma with a transcript and a cover letter
                        as supporting evidence alongside it. This means that the
                        process now entails attesting three documents rather
                        than one. Non-educational or personal certificate
                        attestation process includes the attestation by the
                        state department, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and
                        finally the Embassy of Qatar Commercial documents
                        attestation process includes attestation from the State
                        Department, followed by the attestation of the Ministry
                        of External Affairs, and finally the Embassy of Qatar.
